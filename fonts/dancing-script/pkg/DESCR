Dancing Script is a lively, casual script where the letters bounce and
change size slightly. Caps are big, and go below the baseline. It
references popular script typefaces from the 1950's.

It relates to Murray Hill (Emil Klumpp. 1956) in his weight distribution
and to Mistral (Roger Excoffon. 1953) in his lively bouncing effect.

Use it when you want a friendly, formal and spontaneous look.
