Computer Modern Unicode fonts were converted from metafont sources using
mftrace with autotrace backend and fontforge (former pfaedit). The main
purpose is to create free, good quality fonts for use in X applications
supporting many languages. Currently the fonts contain glyphs from Latin1,
Cyrillic and Greek code sets and IPA extensions.

This set contains 33 fonts, and works better with antialiasing enabled.
