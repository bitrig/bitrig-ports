newsfish is batch USENET news reader. Given a list of newsgroups and a
set of filters for each newsgroup, newfish scans unread articles, applies
the appropriate filters to them, and saves all the matching articles into
mbox-style files. The articles can then be read with any mail program that
understands the mbox format, such as pine.
