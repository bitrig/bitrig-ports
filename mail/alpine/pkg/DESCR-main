Alpine is a screen-oriented message-handling tool.  In its default
configuration, Alpine offers an intentionally limited set of functions
geared toward the novice user, but it also has a large list of optional
"power-user" and personal-preference features.

An optional configuration file "pine.conf" can be put into ${SYSCONFDIR} to set
system wide defaults.  The format of this file is identical to the .pinerc
file that is auto-generated by Alpine in your home directory.

This package is built using the re-alpine source, the continuation of
the Alpine email client from University of Washington.

The passfile flavor builds alpine with the option to store passwords
in the file "~/.pine-passfile".  This should only be used in cases
where you are sure of the security of your local $HOME directory.
